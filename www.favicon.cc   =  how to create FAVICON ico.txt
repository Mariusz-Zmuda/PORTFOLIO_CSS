How to add the favicon to your page ?
Download favicon
Put the favicon.ico file into your webserver directory
This favicon is an animation. Only the Firefox browser supports animated favicons yet. For that reason you need to generate an additional non-animated favicon.ico file.

Add the following lines between the <head> ... </head> tags of the page:

<link rel="shortcut icon" href="/PATH_TO_STATIC_FAVICON/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
<link rel="icon" href="/PATH_TO_ANIMATED_FAVICON/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
Replace PATH_TO_STATIC_FAVICON and PATH_TO_ANIMATED_FAVICON with the correct paths
